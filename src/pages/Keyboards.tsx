            Being an avid PC user and video game player, I think it was only natural that I would eventually look into building a custom mechanical keyboard for myself. What I did not expect was how invested I would get into the hobby; learning about the differences between cases and switches, and even learning and trying out the various DIY mods the community would have to offer. A couple years down the line, I saw myself collecting various boards and building a keyboard for several of my friends!
